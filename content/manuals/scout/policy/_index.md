  Policies in Docker Scout let you define supply chain rules and thresholds
  for your artifacts, and track how your artifacts perform against those
  requirements over time
---

In software supply chain management, maintaining the security and reliability
of artifacts is a top priority. Policy Evaluation in Docker Scout introduces a
layer of control, on top of existing analysis capabilities. It lets you define
supply chain rules for your artifacts, and helps you track how your artifacts
perform, relative to your rules and thresholds, over time.

Learn how you can use Policy Evaluation to ensure that your artifacts align
with established best practices.

## How Policy Evaluation works

When you activate Docker Scout for a repository, images that you push are
[automatically analyzed](/manuals/scout/explore/analysis.md). The analysis gives you insights
about the composition of your images, including what packages they contain and
what vulnerabilities they're exposed to. Policy Evaluation builds on top of the
image analysis feature, interpreting the analysis results against the rules
defined by policies.

A policy defines image quality criteria that your artifacts should fulfill.
For example, the **No AGPL v3 licenses** policy flags any image containing packages distributed under the AGPL v3 license.
If an image contains such a package, that image is non-compliant with this policy.
Some policies, such as the **No AGPL v3 licenses** policy, are configurable.
Configurable policies let you adjust the criteria to better match your organization's needs.

In Docker Scout, policies are designed to help you ratchet forward your
security and supply chain stature. Where other tools focus on providing a pass
or fail status, Docker Scout policies visualizes how small, incremental changes
affect policy status, even when your artifacts don't meet the policy
requirements (yet). By tracking how the fail gap changes over time, you more
easily see whether your artifact is improving or deteriorating relative to
policy.

Policies don't necessarily have to be related to application security and
vulnerabilities. You can use policies to measure and track other aspects of
supply chain management as well, such as open-source license usage and base
image up-to-dateness.

## Policy types

In Docker Scout, a *policy* is derived from a *policy type*. Policy types are
templates that define the core parameters of a policy. You can compare policy
types to classes in object-oriented programming, with each policy acting as an
instance created from its corresponding policy type.

Docker Scout supports the following policy types:

- [Severity-Based Vulnerability](#severity-based-vulnerability)
- [Compliant Licenses](#compliant-licenses)
- [Up-to-Date Base Images](#up-to-date-base-images)
- [High-Profile Vulnerabilities](#high-profile-vulnerabilities)
- [Supply Chain Attestations](#supply-chain-attestations)
- [Default Non-Root User](#default-non-root-user)
- [Approved Base Images](#approved-base-images)
- [SonarQube Quality Gates](#sonarqube-quality-gates)

Docker Scout automatically provides default policies for repositories where it
is enabled, except for the SonarQube Quality Gates policy, which requires
[integration with SonarQube](/manuals/scout/integrations/code-quality/sonarqube.md)
before use.

You can create custom policies from any of the supported policy types, or
delete a default policy if it isn't applicable to your project. For more
information, refer to [Configure policies](./configure.md).

<!-- vale Docker.HeadingSentenceCase = NO -->

### Severity-Based Vulnerability

The **Severity-Based Vulnerability** policy type checks whether your
artifacts are exposed to known vulnerabilities.

By default, this policy only flags critical and high severity vulnerabilities
where there's a fix version available. Essentially, this means that there's an
easy fix that you can deploy for images that fail this policy: upgrade the
vulnerable package to a version containing a fix for the vulnerability.

Images are deemed non-compliant with this policy if they contain one or more
vulnerabilities that fall outside the specified policy criteria.

You can configure the parameters of this policy by creating a custom version of the policy.
The following policy parameters are configurable in a custom version:

- **Age**: The minimum number of days since the vulnerability was first published

  The rationale for only flagging vulnerabilities of a certain minimum age is
  that newly discovered vulnerabilities shouldn't cause your evaluations to
  fail until you've had a chance to address them.

<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->
- **Severities**: Severity levels to consider (default: `Critical, High`)
<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->

- **Fixable vulnerabilities only**: Whether or not to only report
  vulnerabilities with a fix version available (enabled by default).

- **Package types**: List of package types to consider.

  This option lets you specify the package types, as [PURL package type definitions](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-TYPES.rst),
  that you want to include in the policy evaluation. By default, the policy
  considers all package types.

For more information about configuring policies, see [Configure policies](./configure.md).

### Compliant Licenses

The **Compliant Licenses** policy type checks whether your images contain
packages distributed under an inappropriate license. Images are considered
non-compliant if they contain one or more packages with such a license.

You can configure the list of licenses that this policy should look out for,
and add exceptions by specifying an allow-list (in the form of PURLs).
See [Configure policies](./configure.md).

### Up-to-Date Base Images

The **Up-to-Date Base Images** policy type checks whether the base images you
use are up-to-date.

Images are considered non-compliant with this policy if the tag you used to
build your image points to a different digest than what you're using. If
there's a mismatch in digests, that means the base image you're using is out of
date.

Your images need provenance attestations for this policy to successfully
evaluate. For more information, see [No base image data](#no-base-image-data).

### High-Profile Vulnerabilities

The **High-Profile Vulnerabilities** policy type checks whether your images
contain vulnerabilities from Docker Scoutâ€™s curated list. This list is kept
up-to-date with newly disclosed vulnerabilities that are widely recognized to
be risky.

The list includes the following vulnerabilities:

- [CVE-2014-0160 (OpenSSL Heartbleed)](https://scout.docker.com/v/CVE-2014-0160)
- [CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)](https://scout.docker.com/v/CVE-2021-44228)
- [CVE-2023-38545 (cURL SOCKS5 heap buffer overflow)](https://scout.docker.com/v/CVE-2023-38545)
- [CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset)](https://scout.docker.com/v/CVE-2023-44487)
- [CVE-2024-3094 (XZ backdoor)](https://scout.docker.com/v/CVE-2024-3094)
- [CVE-2024-47176 (OpenPrinting - `cups-browsed`)](https://scout.docker.com/v/CVE-2024-47176)
- [CVE-2024-47076 (OpenPrinting - `libcupsfilters`)](https://scout.docker.com/v/CVE-2024-47076)
- [CVE-2024-47175 (OpenPrinting - `libppd`)](https://scout.docker.com/v/CVE-2024-47175)
- [CVE-2024-47177 (OpenPrinting - `cups-filters`)](https://scout.docker.com/v/CVE-2024-47177)

You can customize this policy to change which CVEs that are considered
high-profile by configuring the policy. Custom configuration options include:

- **Excluded CVEs**: Specify the CVEs that you want this policy to ignore.

  Default: `[]` (none of the high-profile CVEs are ignored)

- **CISA KEV**: Enable tracking of vulnerabilities from CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog

  The [CISA KEV catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)
  includes vulnerabilities that are actively exploited in the wild. When enabled,
  the policy flags images that contain vulnerabilities from the CISA KEV catalog.

  Enabled by default.

For more information on policy configuration, see [Configure policies](./configure.md).

### Supply Chain Attestations

The **Supply Chain Attestations** policy type checks whether your images have
[SBOM](/manuals/build/metadata/attestations/sbom.md) and
[provenance](/manuals/build/metadata/attestations/slsa-provenance.md) attestations.

Images are considered non-compliant if they lack either an SBOM attestation or
a provenance attestation with *max mode* provenance. To ensure compliance,
update your build command to attach these attestations at build-time:

```console
$ docker buildx build --provenance=true --sbom=true -t <IMAGE> --push .
```

For more information about building with attestations, see
[Attestations](/manuals/build/metadata/attestations/_index.md).

If you're using GitHub Actions to build and push your images,
learn how you can [configure the action](/manuals/build/ci/github-actions/attestations.md)
to apply SBOM and provenance attestations.

### Default Non-Root User

By default, containers run as the `root` superuser with full system
administration privileges inside the container, unless the Dockerfile specifies
a different default user. Running containers as a privileged user weakens their
runtime security, as it means any code that runs in the container can perform
administrative actions.

The **Default Non-Root User** policy type detects images that are set to run as
the default `root` user. To comply with this policy, images must specify a
non-root user in the image configuration. Images are non-compliant with this
policy if they don't specify a non-root default user for the runtime stage.

For non-compliant images, evaluation results show whether or not the `root`
user was set explicitly for the image. This helps you distinguish between
policy violations caused by images where the `root` user is implicit, and
images where `root` is set on purpose.

The following Dockerfile runs as `root` by default despite not being explicitly set:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine
RUN echo "Hi"
```

Whereas in the following case, the `root` user is explicitly set:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine
USER root
RUN echo "Hi"
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> This policy only checks for the default user of the image, as set in the
> image configuration blob. Even if you do specify a non-root default user,
> it's still possible to override the default user at runtime, for example by
> using the `--user` flag for the `docker run` command.

To make your images compliant with this policy, use the
[`USER`](/reference/dockerfile.md#user) Dockerfile instruction to set
a default user that doesn't have root privileges for the runtime stage.

The following Dockerfile snippets shows the difference between a compliant and
non-compliant image.

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Non-compliant" >}}

```dockerfile
FROM alpine AS builder
COPY Makefile ./src /
RUN make build

FROM alpine AS runtime
COPY --from=builder bin/production /app
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/production"]
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Compliant" >}}

```dockerfile {hl_lines=7}
FROM alpine AS builder
COPY Makefile ./src /
RUN make build

FROM alpine AS runtime
COPY --from=builder bin/production /app
USER nonroot
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/production"]
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Approved Base Images

The **Approved Base Images** policy type ensures that the base images you use
in your builds are maintained and secure.

This policy checks whether the base images used in your builds match any of the
patterns specified in the policy configuration. The following table shows a few
example patterns for this policy.

| Use case                                                        | Pattern                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Allow all images from Docker Hub                                | `docker.io/*`                    |
| Allow all Docker Official Images                                | `docker.io/library/*`            |
| Allow images from a specific organization                       | `docker.io/orgname/*`            |
| Allow tags of a specific repository                             | `docker.io/orgname/repository:*` |
| Allow images on a registry with hostname `registry.example.com` | `registry.example.com/*`         |
| Allow slim tags of NodeJS images                                | `docker.io/library/node:*-slim`  |

An asterisk (`*`) matches up until the character that follows, or until the end
of the image reference. Note that the `docker.io` prefix is required in order
to match Docker Hub images. This is the registry hostname of Docker Hub.

This policy is configurable with the following options:

- **Approved base image sources**

  Specify the image reference patterns that you want to allow. The policy
  evaluates the base image references against these patterns.

  Default: `[*]` (any reference is an allowed base image)

- **Only supported tags**

  Allow only supported tags when using Docker Official Images.

  When this option is enabled, images using unsupported tags of official images
  as their base image trigger a policy violation. Supported tags for official
  images are listed in the **Supported tags** section of the repository
  overview on Docker Hub.

  Enabled by default.

- **Only supported OS distributions**

  Allow only Docker Official Images of supported Linux distribution versions.

  When this option is enabled, images using unsupported Linux distributions
  that have reached end of life (such as `ubuntu:18.04`) trigger a policy violation.

  Enabling this option may cause the policy to report no data
  if the operating system version cannot be determined.

  Enabled by default.

Your images need provenance attestations for this policy to successfully
evaluate. For more information, see [No base image data](#no-base-image-data).

### SonarQube Quality Gates

The **SonarQube Quality Gates** policy type builds on the [SonarQube
integration](../integrations/code-quality/sonarqube.md) to assess the quality
of your source code. This policy works by ingesting the SonarQube code analysis
results into Docker Scout.

You define the criteria for this policy using SonarQube's [quality
gates](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/user-guide/quality-gates/).
SonarQube evaluates your source code against the quality gates you've defined
in SonarQube. Docker Scout surfaces the SonarQube assessment as a Docker Scout
policy.

Docker Scout uses [provenance](/manuals/build/metadata/attestations/slsa-provenance.md)
attestations or the `org.opencontainers.image.revision` OCI annotation to link
SonarQube analysis results with container images. In addition to enabling the
SonarQube integration, you must also make sure that your images have either the
attestation or the label.

![Git commit SHA links image with SonarQube analysis](../images/scout-sq-commit-sha.webp)

Once you push an image and policy evaluation completes, the results from the
SonarQube quality gates display as a policy in the Docker Scout Dashboard, and
in the CLI.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Docker Scout can only access SonarQube analyses created after the integration
> is enabled. Docker Scout doesn't have access to historic evaluations. Trigger
> a SonarQube analysis and policy evaluation after enabling the integration to
> view the results in Docker Scout.

## No base image data

There are cases when it's not possible to determine information about the base
images used in your builds. In such cases, the **Up-to-Date Base Images** and
**Approved Base Images** policies get flagged as having **No data**.

This "no data" state occurs when:

- Docker Scout doesn't know what base image tag you used
- The base image version you used has multiple tags, but not all tags are out
  of date

To make sure that Docker Scout always knows about your base image, you can
attach [provenance attestations](/manuals/build/metadata/attestations/slsa-provenance.md)
at build-time. Docker Scout uses provenance attestations to find out the base
image version.
