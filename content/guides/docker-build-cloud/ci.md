Since the builds run remotely, your CI runner can still use the Docker tooling CLI
without needing elevated permissions, making your builds more secure by default.

In this demo, you will see:

- How to integrate Docker Build Cloud into a variety of CI platforms
- How to use Docker Build Cloud in GitHub Actions to build multi-architecture images
