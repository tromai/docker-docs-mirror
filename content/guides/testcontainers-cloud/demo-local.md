This demo shows the process of setting up Testcontainers Cloud by Docker to
work in your local development environment using the Testcontainers Desktop
application. By the end of this walkthrough, you'll have Testcontainers Cloud
by Docker up and running, ready to offload container management from your local
machine to the cloud for more efficient testing.

- Install and configure Testcontainers Cloud and the CLI to seamlessly integrate with your local development environment.
- Set up and configure the Testcontainers Desktop application to monitor and manage cloud-based containers during local tests.
- Create and run integration tests using Testcontainers that leverage cloud-based container resources.
- Monitor and manage containers efficiently, understanding how Testcontainers Cloud automates cleanup and ensures consistent testing environments.
- Review options for monitoring and troubleshooting in the Testcontainers Cloud Dashboard.
